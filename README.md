Problem Statement
The stock trade tracker application aims to solve the real-world problem of efficiently managing stock trading activities for users. Users should be able to track traders, stocks, and trades, ensuring accurate records of their trading activities. The application needs to provide functionality for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting trades, along with managing stock and trader information.
Solution
 By streamlining the tracking process, the application will help users make informed trading decisions and maintain organized records of their investments.
    • Organization of Data:
    • The application consolidates all trading information in one place, making it easier for users to track their trades, stocks, and trader profiles without needing to manage multiple sources or spreadsheets.
    • Real-Time Updates:
    • Users can quickly view their current holdings, past trades, and performance metrics, enabling informed decision-making in real time. This helps users react promptly to market changes.
    • Performance Tracking:
    • The tracker allows users to analyze their trading history and performance over time. By reviewing past trades, users can identify successful strategies or areas needing improvement.
    • Simplified Trade Execution:
    • By providing a user-friendly interface for entering trades, the application reduces the complexity of trade execution. Users can easily input trade details without worrying about manual errors.
    • Risk Management:
    • Users can set alerts for specific stock prices or trade conditions, helping them manage risk by acting when certain thresholds are met.
    • Historical Analysis:
    • Users can access historical data on stock performance and their own trading activity, enabling them to make better predictions about future market behavior.
    • Comprehensive Reporting:
    • The application can generate reports summarizing trading activity, which can help users for tax purposes or to present to financial advisors.
    • Integration with External Data:
    • If the application connects to APIs for real-time stock prices or news, it can provide users with up-to-date information directly within the platform.
